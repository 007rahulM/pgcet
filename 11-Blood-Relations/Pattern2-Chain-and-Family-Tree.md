## ✅ Step-by-Step Examples

### Example 1

**❓ Question:** A is B's father. C is A's sister. D is C's mother. How is D related to B?

**🤔 What I understood:**
- Given: A chain of 4 people — A is B's father, C is A's sister, D is C's mother
- Find: How D is related to B

**💡 What I'll use:** Draw a family tree and trace each link step by step

**✏️ My Solution:**

Step 1: A is B's father → A is one generation above B

Step 2: C is A's sister → C and A are siblings (same generation as A)

Step 3: D is C's mother → D is one generation above C (and A)

Step 4: D is A's mother, A is B's father → D is B's grandmother

```
    D (female)
    │
    ├── A (male) ─── C (female)
    │
    B
```

**✅ Answer: D is B's Grandmother**

---

### Example 2

**❓ Question:** A is B's mother. C is A's father. D is C's wife. How is D related to B?

**🤔 What I understood:**
- Given: A is B's mother, C is A's father, D is C's wife
- Find: How D is related to B

**💡 What I'll use:** Draw a family tree and trace each link step by step

**✏️ My Solution:**

Step 1: A is B's mother → A is one generation above B

Step 2: C is A's father → C is one generation above A (two above B)

Step 3: D is C's wife → D and C are married; D is A's mother

Step 4: D is A's mother, A is B's mother → D is B's grandmother

```
D ═══ C
       │
       A
       │
       B
```

**✅ Answer: D is B's Grandmother**

---

### Example 3

**❓ Question:** A said to B: "Your mother's husband's sister is my aunt." How is A related to B?

**🤔 What I understood:**
- Given: A describes a person as "B's mother's husband's sister" and says she is A's aunt
- Find: How A is related to B

**💡 What I'll use:** Simplify each phrase step by step, then compare positions in the family

**✏️ My Solution:**

Step 1: "B's mother's husband" = B's father

Step 2: "B's father's sister" = B's aunt (paternal)

Step 3: That same person is also A's aunt → A and B share the same paternal aunt

Step 4: Sharing the same father's sister means they share the same father → A and B are siblings

**✅ Answer: A is B's Sibling (brother or sister)**

---

### Example 4

**❓ Question:** A is B's brother. B is C's brother. D is C's mother. How is A related to D?

**🤔 What I understood:**
- Given: A, B, and C are connected through sibling relationships; D is C's mother
- Find: How A is related to D

**💡 What I'll use:** Draw a family tree and trace each link step by step

**✏️ My Solution:**

Step 1: A is B's brother and B is C's brother → A, B, and C are all siblings

Step 2: D is C's mother → D is the mother of all three (A, B, and C)

```
D (mother)
│
├── A
├── B
└── C
```

**✅ Answer: D is A's Mother**

---

### Example 5

**❓ Question:** P is Q's sister. R is Q's mother. S is R's father. T is S's wife. How is P related to T?

**🤔 What I understood:**
- Given: A chain of 5 people — P is Q's sister, R is Q's mother, S is R's father, T is S's wife
- Find: How P is related to T

**💡 What I'll use:** Draw a family tree and trace each link step by step

**✏️ My Solution:**

Step 1: P is Q's sister → P and Q are siblings (same generation)

Step 2: R is Q's mother → R is also P's mother

Step 3: S is R's father → S is P's grandfather

Step 4: T is S's wife → T is P's grandmother

```
T ═══ S
       │
       R
       │
    ┌──┴──┐
    Q     P
```

**✅ Answer: T is P's Grandmother**


### Data Sufficiency Variant (Relation can/cannot be decided)

In some questions, two statements (A and B) are provided and you must decide whether relation is determinable.

**Rule:**
- If gender + family link are both fixed, relation is decidable.
- If one statement gives only gender or only relation chain, it may be insufficient.
- Check A alone, B alone, then A+B.

**Mini Example:**
A: X is Y's sister.  
B: Z is father of X and Y.

A alone gives X's gender and direct relation to Y, so relation **is already decidable** (X is sister of Y).

## ⚡ 60-Second Shortcut

**Steps for chain problems:**
1. Draw the family tree as you read
2. Start from a known person and trace step by step
3. Count generations to identify grandparent/grandchild
4. Check gender for uncle/aunt vs brother/sister

**Quick recognition:**
- 2 generations up = grandparent
- 2 generations down = grandchild
- Same generation + parent's sibling's child = cousin
- Parent's sibling = uncle/aunt
